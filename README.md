This project contains the Arduino code and Proteus simulation circuit for a traffic signal light system implemented using Arduino microcontroller. The system simulates the operation of traffic signal lights including red, yellow, and green lights, following a predefined sequence. 

### Features:
- Implements a basic traffic signal light system using Arduino.
- Simulated using Proteus software for testing and visualization.
- Includes schematic diagrams for setup and usage.

### Components:
- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- LEDs for red, yellow, and green
